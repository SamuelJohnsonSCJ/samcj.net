# samcj.net

This is my website at <https://samcj.net>

Parts (most really) of this website were made by following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/Wm6CUkswsNw) by [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/).

I was unable to find any copyright information as to the use of code from said tutorial, but they provided a download to the page created in it in the description of the video so I think it's probably fine...

If you are Traversy Media and want me to take this site down, let me know by email: <sam@samcj.net>.

The samcj.net/home -> samcj.net redirect was created using [a redirect generator](http://insider.zone/tools/client-side-url-redirect-generator/) by [Insider Zone](http://insider.zone/). (Neither of those two links work anymore but on the redirect generator page it said to credit them... I think. It was a few years ago.)

If you are Insider Zone and want me to stop using that redirect page, let me know by email: <sam@samcj.net>.
